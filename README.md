## About this application


## Docker
Dockerfiles can be found for backend in directory <b>docker-backend</b>, for frontend at
<b>src\main\kotlin\org\ocpp\server\frontend</b>.

Docker compose file can be found in directory <b>docker-backend</b>.

### Run in Docker
In order to run the database, backend and frontend via the compose file run the following commands
<ol>
    <li>Go to folder <b>docker-backend</b></li>
    <li>Run the file <b>publish.bat</b> in the terminal. This builds the required jar file for docker</li>
